How would You deal with that? I mean if someone says &quot;Hey Im hacking im an alt of xyz&quot; You cant really ban the player just for claiming they are a certain person on an alt. Im not sure what players use to dodge IP Bans but its really annoyong wanting to play on a server and a Hacker You just banned is right back on an alt. I understand that that falls under &quot;Ban Evasion&quot; but...<br />

OPlifesteal would be 10X better if there wasn&#039;t so many hackers using combat hacks on that server . The hackers are known and constantly reported but with no results. I am planning on applying for staff as Pika def needs support in the OPLifesteal server . Is there anything we can do to make the server better w out just constantly reporting players to no avail?</div>]]></content:encoded>
